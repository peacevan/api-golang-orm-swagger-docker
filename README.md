> About Repository showcasing a Go API with ORM, Swagger, and Docker. It leverages the Gin framework, GORM for ORM, and Swag for documentation. Docker streamlines development and deployment.

## Requirements:
   
 Develop an API in Go using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for interaction with the database,
 where it will be possible to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the entities 
 Client, Product, Order, and OrderItem. The API should be documented using Swagger to facilitate 
 understanding and integration by developers. Additionally, the system should be containerized using 
 Docker to ensure portability and ease deployment in different environments.

### Adjustments and improvements

The project is still under development and the next updates will be detailed in the following tasks:
Create a small goang + Angular app for orders management


 ## API implementation
- [x] Create rotes(restFull)  
- [x] Configuration package configuration
- [x] Add ORM
- [x] Add swagger API documentation
- [x] API dockerization
- [ ] Connect API in Postgresql

## Front-end Implementation with Angular 
- [ ] List orders in a table
- [ ] Add pagination (10 orders/page)
- [ ] Allow users to cancel an order (persist the change in db)
- [ ] Allow users to search for orders by customer or status
